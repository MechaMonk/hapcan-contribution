HAPCAN contribution
===================

This is a collaboration of work I've done related to my home automation system based on HAPCAN.

HAPCAN is a completely open source home automation system with wired components communicating over CAN bus. It is comparable with KNX, but far cheaper. Due to the open source nature and the use of CAN, it is also much better suited for those interested in making their own modules.

This has no connection with the HAPCAN project, and modules are therefore called "HAPCAN compatible", as they can communicate with HAPCAN devices but are not actual HAPCAN devices. It can rather be seen as a contribution to the HAPCAN community.
