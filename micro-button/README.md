HAPCAN compatible micro button interface
========================================

A firmware compatible re-make of the HAPCAN button module.

I made it because I wanted a board with connectors and smaller outline. Version 2 runs on 3.3 V and uses a small switch mode buck converter to minimize power consumption.
